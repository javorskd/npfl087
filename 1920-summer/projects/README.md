# NPFL087 Projects in 2019/2020 Summer Term

Everyone please create a directory here with the name listing his/her name and the project title, e.g. `ondrej_bojar_-_spoken_language_translation`.

Even if you prefer to store your code and report elsewhere, *do* create the directory here and just provide a `README.md` with a link to the repository.

## Very Important Warning

Github does not like large files, so *never ever* commit anything bigger than a
megabyte or two. For such big files, commit a placeholder, e.g.
`my-big-file.url` with the URL to download it.
